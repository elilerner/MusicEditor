We put individual READ ME files in each package. Look there for updates.

HOW TO PERFORM ACTIONS ON GUI:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pause Play:
The Music and GUI automatically play from initiation.

Key: SPACE_BAR

The SpaceBar is used to Pause and Play Music.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adding a new Note: (used Mouse Events)
We wanted to make adding Notes as easy as possible. So we made the only thing that matter be the
Y position of the Mouse. A Note will be added at the beat where the Red Line currently resides in.

Mouse: BUTTON_1

Button one click event is used to add notes when the composition is paused.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scroll Through Composition with Arrow Keys

Scrolling through the composition could not be easier with our design. Simply use LEFT arrow key to
Scroll left and RIGHT arrow key go right.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jump to the beginning or end of the composition, via the Home or End keys

Jumping to the beginning or end of the composition has never been easier with our implementation.
Ever want to go to the beginning or end of a song but had to first Pause the composition in order
to do so?
Well now you don't have to worry about that! We made this simple. Simply press the Home key to go
to the beginning and End key to go to the end of the song. You can do this while the song is played
or paused. The song will resume from wherever the Red Line Location is.
